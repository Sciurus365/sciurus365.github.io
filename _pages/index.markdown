Hello! My name is Jingmeng Cui, and I am currently a PhD student at the Nieuwenhuis Institute, University of Groningen, the Netherlands. My main research interest focuses on mathematical and statistical modeling of the dynamics of psycho(pathology). With an interdisciplinary background, I believe combining the insights from all the related fields can lead to a better understanding of human psychology, and to the ultimate improve the well-being of all mankind. To get a glance at what I'm doing now, you can check out our recent preprint [here](https://psyarxiv.com/49xyg).

Besides the project on psychological models, I also did some work in the development of LGBT adolescents, social network analysis, and text analysis. Seemingly unrelated, these works are all about using advanced methods to understand people and enhance their well-being, which is where my strongest motivation lies.
