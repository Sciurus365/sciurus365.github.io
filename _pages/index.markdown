Hello! My name is Jingmeng Cui, and I am currently a PhD student at the Nieuwenhuis Institute, University of Groningen, the Netherlands ([my university homepage](https://www.rug.nl/staff/jingmeng.cui/)). My main research interest focuses on mathematical and statistical modeling of the dynamics of psycho(pathology). Before coming to Groningen, I received my Research Master's degree in Behavioural Sciences from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/), the Netherlands. and my Bachelor's degrees in Material Chemistry and in Psychology from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), China. 

With an interdisciplinary background, I believe combining insights from all the related fields can lead to a better understanding of human psychology, and ultimately improve the well-being of all mankind. To get a glance at what I'm doing now, you can check out our recent paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2022.2119927) and our recent preprint [here](https://psyarxiv.com/59fu4/).
