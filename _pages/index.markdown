Hello! My name is Jingmeng Cui, and I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the [Research Group of Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/home/), KU Leuven, Belgium, supervised by [Prof. Francis Tuerlinckx](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/team/Francis_Tuerlinckx/) and [Prof. Eva Ceulemans](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/team/Eva_Ceulemans/). My research focuses on developing theories and methods from a complex-systems perspective to better understand psychological processes and psychopathology.

Before starting this position, I completed my PhD ([thesis](https://doi.org/10.33612/diss.1422145646)) in November, 2025, at University of Groningen, the Netherlands, supervised by [Prof. Anna Lichtwarck-Aschoff](https://www.rug.nl/staff/a.lichtwarck-aschoff/) and [Dr. Fred Hasselman](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/hasselman-f). I also obtained a Research Master's degree (2021) in Behavioural Sciences from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/), the Netherlands, and Bachelor's degrees in Material Chemistry and Psychology (2019) from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), China.

Besides my current research group, I'm also actively involved in the [CiBS](https://cibs-nl.netlify.app/) (Complexity in Behavioral Science) research group and the [MITNB](https://mitnb.org/) (Measurement is the New Black) consortium.
