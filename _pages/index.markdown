Hello! My name is Jingmeng Cui, and I am currently a PhD student at the Nieuwenhuis Institute, University of Groningen, the Netherlands ([university homepage](https://www.rug.nl/staff/jingmeng.cui/)). I am supervised by [Prof. Anna Lichtwarck-Aschoff](https://www.rug.nl/staff/a.lichtwarck-aschoff/) and [Dr. Fred Hasselman](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/hasselman-f).

My research focuses on developing theories and methods from a complex-systems perspective to better understand psychological processes and psychopathology.

Before coming to Groningen, I obtained a Research Master's degree in Behavioural Sciences from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/), the Netherlands, and Bachelor's degrees in Material Chemistry and Psychology from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), China.

I am a member of the [CiBS](https://cibs-nl.netlify.app/) (Complexity in Behavioral Science) research group and actively involved in the [MITNB](https://mitnb.org/) (Measurement is the New Black) consortium.
